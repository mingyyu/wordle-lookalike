# Wordle Game

Welcome to the Wordle Game project! This is a web-based game where players try to guess a hidden word by entering guesses and receiving feedback.

## Overview

The Wordle Game is a simple and entertaining word-guessing game. Players enter words, and the game provides feedback on each guess, indicating correct letters in the correct position, correct letters in the wrong position, and incorrect letters. The objective is to guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## Features

- **Guess Feedback:** Each guess is color-coded to provide feedback on the correctness of the letters.
- **Word of the Day:** The DAILY version of the game hosts the same word for everyone on the same day, allowing you to compare your competency with that of your friends.
- **Dynamic Word Selection:** The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list at the start of each round when you're playing the UNLIMITED version.
- **Results:** When the game is completed, feedback and an option to share your results with your friends appears on the screen.

## How to Play

1. Enter your guesses in the input field.
2. Upon submission, each letter is color-coded as a feedback:
   - **Green:** Correct letter in the correct position.
   - **Yellow:** Correct letter in the wrong position.
   - **Grey:** Incorrect letter.
3. Use the feedback to refine your guesses and uncover the hidden word!
